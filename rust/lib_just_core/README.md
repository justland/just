# lib_just_core

Crate that contains core data structures and their basic manuplications.

This is the central piece in Clean Architecture.
Not really application agnostic,
but does not contain logic for specific domains such as parsing, optimization, checker, etc.

This crate sits at the bottom of the dependency tree.

TODO: Move into `justc0`
