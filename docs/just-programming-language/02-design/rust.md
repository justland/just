# Rust

Here are the pros and cons of `Rust`:

|                     |                                                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 👍 ownership system | this is a paradigm shifting killer feature                      |
| 👍 efficient        | produce highly performant binary                                |
| 😐 macro            | while it makes certain task easier, also complicates the system |
| 👎 nominal type     | a huge limitation in component design                           |

## Macro

Macro takes a pretty dominant role in `Rust`.
It simplifies some constructs in `Rust` to make them easier to use.

*Just* plan on macro is still pending,
and will use other means such as aspect programming, generic, and type interence,
to fill some of the use cases of macro in `Rust`.

*Just* will strive for `homoiconic`,
although it is remain to be seen if it is feasible or not.
