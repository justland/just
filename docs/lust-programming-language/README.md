# Lust Programming Language

*Lust* is a alternative *Lisp* like syntax of *Just*.

## Why

For basic syntax, *Lisp* is a lot cleaner and more compact.

The major downfall of *Lisp* is the lack of static-types,
making the code harder to read at times.

*Just* is design along with *Lust* so that the syntax is similar in both languages,
so that the syntax is more consistent, stable, and easier to reason about.

For now, no development in *lust* is planned.
It is just for developing the syntax for *just*.
